Error in rule xvlog:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job xvlog since they might be corrupted:
/home/seankent/bluejay/ip/jay/sim/gen/sim__a/xvlog.ts
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
