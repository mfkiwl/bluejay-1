MissingOutputException in rule sim__wdb in file /home/seankent/bluejay/Snakefile, line 9:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/seankent/bluejay/ip/jay/sim/gen/sim__xyz/ADD-01/snapshot.wdb
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
